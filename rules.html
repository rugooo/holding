  Rugooo&trade; is a simple throwing game for two or more people. To play you will need a Rugooo&trade; target and a number of throwing Rugooo&trade; or “rugs”.
</p>
<p>The objective is to land the eye of the rug over the golden nipple in the centre of the target.</p>

<p>
In Classic Rugooo&trade; players take it in turns to throw three rugs (one at a time), this is known as a hand. After throwing their full hand, the score is totalled and added to the scoreboard. Scoring is determined by the colour seen through the eye of the rug; 1, 2 and 3 points respectively for the outer to inner rings and 9 points if the nipple is exposed by the eye of the rug.</p>
<p>When a rug exposes the nipple during play, it can be removed from the target.</p>
<p>When two colours can be seen, the predominant colour is scored. If both colours are seen equally then the higher score is taken.</p>
<p>When one rug is obscuring the eye of another, the bottom rug should be scored first, this is achieved by pressing down on one side of the top rug so as not to change its’ position on the target, then lifting the opposite side to reveal the bottom rugs score. The obscured rug can then be removed to allow the top one(s) to be scored.</p>

<p>
  Any rug landing upside down is known as a “flipper” and does not score any points!

  Before a game begins, two things need to be agreed: <br>
1) The placement of the target and where you are throwing from; Rugooo&trade; is normally played with a distance of four metres between the nipple and the throw line. However, this can be adapted to the space you are playing in and the ability of those playing. <br>
2) The number of hands to be played; We suggest seven hands if there are two or three players, five
hands if there are four to six players and as few as three hands if there are more. This too can be
adapted depending on the time you have.

These are the classic rules of rug chucking, however, there are many other ways to play. For example, the simple game of “One Rug Knockout”, where a group of players throw a single Rugooo&trade; in rounds. The furthest from the nipple in each round is eliminated until there is one ultimate winner.
This is a good game for a larger number of players wishing to have a faster paced game, or simply for deciding who goes first in a game of Classic Rugooo&trade;</p>
